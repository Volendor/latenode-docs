 llama--b-chat-int

AI models for natural language understanding and chatbot applications.


 Model Description

The `@cf/meta/llama--b-chat-int` model includes two nodes:

- llama--b-chat-int Prompt (preview)

- llama--b-chat-int With History (preview)



Model ID: `@cf/meta/llama--b-chat-int`. Quantized (int) generative text model with  billion parameters from Meta.

️

Maximum number of input tokens: \. Output sizes: 

  

The model is designed for natural language communication tasks such as chatbots, assistants, answer generation, etc. The main features and applications of this model are:

\. Model size: The LLaMA--B model has a size of . billion parameters, which allows it to achieve high performance and quality of generated text.

\. Use of int quantization: The model uses int quantization, which reduces the model size and speeds up the output without significant loss in quality.

\. Optimization for chat tasks: The model has been specially trained and optimized for conversational communication tasks such as user support, answering questions, and generating chat responses.

\. Openness and Accessibility: The model is open and accessible for use by researchers and developers. This makes it easy to integrate it into various applications and systems.

This model can be used in the following scenarios:

- Building dialog systems and chatbots

- Generating answers to user questions

- Automating customer support

- Creating assistants with the ability to communicate in natural language

- Extending the capabilities of existing applications by adding communication features

  

 Example of launching a node

Let's run the llama--b-chat-int Prompt (preview) node to process the text and generate a response with parameters:

- User Prompt - _How do you handle complex tasks such as natural language processing or image recognition?_

- Max Tokens (Answer Size) \- .

I'm trained on a vast dataset of images, each labeled with the object or scene they depict. points By analyzing these images, I've learned to identify patterns and features that are unique to each object or scene. nods\nBut it's not just about recognizing images or understanding language. smiles I'm also able to learn and improve over time, thanks to the power of machine"
