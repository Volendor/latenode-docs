 Twitter (X)

Managing incident response automation with Twitter (X).


 \. Creating an App

Go to the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard)

In the Projects section, select the Default project (it is created automatically)

Click Add App

The app is now created — but don't save the keys yet.

We’ll return here later to get the necessary data.

  

 \. Setting Permissions

Go to User authentication settings

![Notion Image](https://www.notion.so/image/attachment%Abfdedb-ee--a-ff%Abrave_MYuvfoXve.png?table=block&id=ed-a-ef--edc&cache=v)

Set the necessary permissions (e.g., Read and Write)

![Notion Image](https://www.notion.so/image/attachment%Acfbb-ac---cbcaa%Abrave_VAWVjREEP.png?table=block&id=ed-a-d-bec-efdefe&cache=v)

In the Type of App section, select:

 Native App — Public client

In the App info block, make sure to enter the following values exactly:

 Callback URL / Redirect URL:

`https://app.latenode.com/redirected/index.html`

 Website URL:

`https://app.latenode.com/connections`

![Notion Image](https://www.notion.so/image/attachment%Aede--a-a-abaff%Abrave_jXregRSfIG.png?table=block&id=ed-a--cbc-cef&cache=v)

️ Important: These fields must be entered exactly as shown — otherwise, the authorization won’t work.

  

After this, you'll receive the Client ID and Client Secret.

These are the values you need to paste into the authorization form in Latenode, then confirm login.
