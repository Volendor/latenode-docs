The CRON expression field is automatically populated in accordance with the configured parameters.

The scenario will operate based on the corresponding CRON expression if the scenario itself is active and deployed in the Production branch.

To disable the scenario from running on a schedule, you can either set it to an inactive state ( Paused status) using the Activity toggle or remove the Trigger on Schedule node from the scenario.

This is the field for selecting the timezone in which you want to configure the schedule.
