 Output Type

Field for configuring the type of response to the request in a Nodul type scenario. The response can be either a successful execution (Ok) or an error (Error). There is a toggle switch above the field called Selection/Substitution. Depending on the chosen value in the Output Type field, you can:

- Select a value from the dropdown list: Ok, Error;



- Substitute any values, including values or parameters from other nodes. Operators can also be used.

 Result

This field represents the response generated by the NodulOutput node upon receiving the selected response from the previous node specified in the Output Type field.



In the Result field, you can input text, variables from other nodes, or parameters from responses received from other nodes.



Any value other than Ok will be interpreted as an error, similar to the Error value.
