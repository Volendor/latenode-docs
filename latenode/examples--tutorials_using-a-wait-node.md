 Using a Wait node

Delaying scenario execution between actions.


As an example of using the Wait node, let's create a scenario that would result in the creation of a global variable some time after the scenario is run.

Three nodes must be added for the scenario to work successfully:

- (  ) Trigger on Run once node to run the scenario after clicking the Run once button;

- (  ) Wait node to configure a  second pause when the scenario runs;

- (  ) SetGlobalVariables node to create a global variable `TestWaitNode` as the outcome of the scenario execution. The created global variable is available for viewing on the Global Variables page.

The result of the scenario execution is a global variable created one minute after the scenario was run.
