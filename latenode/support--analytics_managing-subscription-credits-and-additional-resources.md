 Managing Subscription, Credits, and Additional Resources

Overview of billing, credits, boosts, and token types


 Billing Page

When a paid plan or trial is active, the Billing section becomes available in your account's left menu. On this page, you can see your current plan, the number of available credits, a Manage payments button, and tabs for Extra Credits, Boosts, and Plug&Play Tokens.

Below, you’ll find all available plans: Micro, Starter, Grow, and Prime. Each plan card displays:

- The number of included credits

- Limits on scenarios, flows, triggers, etc.

- A button to start a trial or activate the plan (if not activated before)

The current balance is also always visible in the left menu on any Latenode page:

 Latenode Credits (Execution Credits)

Latenode uses Execution Credits — units that are consumed for executing actions inside scenarios.

 credit =  seconds of scenario runtime.

You can run any number of operations within those  seconds — API requests, AI Copilot, data transformations, JS processing, etc. The system doesn't count each operation — only the total runtime matters.

Some plans support partial credit consumption.

 Minimum consumption by plan:

- Micro — . credit

- Starter — . credit

- Grow — . credit

- Prime — . credit

 Examples:

- A scenario runs for  seconds:

Micro →  credit
Starter →  credit
Grow → . credits
Prime → . credit

- A scenario runs for  seconds:

 credits will be consumed

  

 Plug&Play Credits (PnP Tokens)

Plug&Play credits (PnP) allow you to use advanced AI models and external tools marked with a dollar sign without registering or subscribing to those third-party services. You simply run the respective node — everything is processed through Latenode.

Credits are charged based on the actual tokens used by the connected AI service.

For example:

- If an AI request uses , tokens via OpenAI, a matching amount of PnP credits will be deducted

_(Pricing is shown inside each Plug&Play node)_

The consumption depends on the model used, output size, and complexity.

You only pay for what you use — no fixed costs per request.

> ️ Please note: PnP credits are non-refundable, even if unused or if the subscription is canceled.

Some nodes — like personal WhatsApp, Telegram, or LinkedIn accounts — require paid authorization.

You will see a warning about this when creating an authorization:

 Boosts

![Notion Image](https://www.notion.so/image/attachment%Afaece-bdd-ef-ba-bca%Avivaldi_NhnzpddbO.png?table=block&id=ed-a--add-eadabe&cache=v)

Boosts are add-ons that expand your plan’s capabilities. Depending on the boost type, they:

- Add more credits

- Increase limits for triggers, flows, or accounts

- Reduce the minimum scenario interval

Boosts are purchased separately and do not expire at the end of the month.

 Extra Credits

If your included credits aren’t enough — you can purchase Extra Credits. These are added to your balance and used after the monthly limit is reached.

They do not expire and are always used after the included credits are depleted.
