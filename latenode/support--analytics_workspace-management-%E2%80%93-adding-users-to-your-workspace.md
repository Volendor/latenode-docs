 Workspace Management – adding users to your workspace

Viewing and analyzing scenario execution data.


Allows you to add an existing Latenode user to your account with management permissions (excluding subscription and user management). This is designed for partners who need access to client accounts with seamless one-click switching between workspaces.



This is not a classic invite system. You can only add a user who is already registered, activated, and has an active account (subscription, trial, or LTD).

 Access Rights

The added user can:

- View, run, edit, and delete scenarios

- Manage account structure, scenarios, and databases

- Cannot: change the plan, manage billing, or add/remove other users

 How to Add a User

 Switching Between Accounts

After being added, the user will be able to switch between their own and connected accounts using the workspace switcher in the top menu.

The account you've granted access to can switch to your workspace by clicking the account switcher menu in the top navigation and selecting your account from the dropdown list.
