 tinyllama-.b-chat-v.

Lightweight AI model for chatbot automation.


 Model description

The `@cf/tinyllama/tinyllama-.b-chat-v.` model includes two nodes:

- tinyllama-.b-chat-v. Prompt (preview)

- tinyllama-.b-chat-v. With History (preview)



Model ID: `@cf/tinyllama/tinyllama-.b-chat-v.`. The TinyLlama project aims to pre-train a . billion Llama model on  trillion tokens. It is a chat model refined from TinyLlama/TinyLlama-.B-intermediate-step-k-T.

  

The tinyllama-.b-chat-v. model is a chat model that was trained based on a pre-trained TinyLlama model with . billion parameters.

The main features of this model are:

\. It was pre-trained on  trillion tokens as part of the TinyLlama project. This allowed the model to gain extensive background knowledge.

\. The model was then further trained (fine-tuned) specifically for chatbot tasks. This improved its ability to dialog, generate relevant and coherent responses.

\. The result is a model that combines the powerful language base of TinyLlama with additional improvements for chatbot applications.

Thus, this model is intended for use in chatbots and other dialog systems where it is necessary to generate meaningful and context-sensitive responses.

  

 Example of launching a node

Let's run the tinyllama-.b-chat-v. Prompt (preview) node to process the text and generate a response with parameters:

- User Prompt - _What's the best way to start the day?;_

- Max Tokens (Answer Size) \- .

- with a response to the `"response"` request;

- with the status of the action `"success": true`.

  "result": {
    "errors": [],
    "messages": [],
    "result": {
      "response": "The best way to start the day is to make a list of things you want to accomplish that day - the goals you've set for yourself. Break those goals into smaller, more achievable tasks and schedule them so they start within an hour. Then, at the start of your day, take a deep breath, stretch, and thank yourself for committing to yourself to make these improvements to yourself. This will set the tone for your day and help you feel more motivated and unstoppable. Walking, taking a walk outside, or simply walking throughout your household for a while, could also be a really great start to any morning, depending on your situation."
