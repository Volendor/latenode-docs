 Usage statistics

Viewing and analyzing scenario execution data.


Access a dedicated page to:

- View data about your tariff plan.

- Analyze statistics for all executed scenarios.

 Key Information

_Each scenario consumes  credit every  seconds during its execution._

To ensure your scenarios run smoothly, monitor your current credit balance. If there are no available credits, the scenario will not execute.

The number of available credits depends on your selected pricing plan.



Running a single node does not require credits, enabling free scenario customization. When executing a scenario that includes a Nodul type scenario, credits will be consumed based on the execution time of the main scenario. The execution time of the Nodul scenario itself is not counted towards credit usage.

If a scenario runs for less than  seconds, the number of credits used will depend on your pricing plan:

- Starter: Minimum charge is  credit ( seconds or less).

- Grow: Minimum charge is . credits ( seconds or less).

- Prime: Minimum charge is . credits ( seconds or less).

 Understanding Credits

A credit is a virtual currency used by scenarios during execution. One credit equals  seconds of scenario execution.

The number of nodes in a scenario does not directly impact credit consumption. For example, scenarios with  nodes and  nodes, each running for less than  seconds, will consume only one credit during execution.



Scenarios with many nodes generally take longer to execute than those with fewer nodes. Additionally, scenarios that transform or process large amounts of data also require more time to run.

Consider the following example of credit consumption:

\. Run the test scenario. In the execution history, the initial run on .. (  ) took eighteen seconds and performed  operations (  ):

\. On the statistics page, review the total number of credits spent on .. and the credits used for running the test scenario.

- The total number of credits is sixteen (  ).

- One credit was spent on the test scenario (  ).

\. Run the test scenario again with an increased amount of processed data. In the execution history, the second run on .. (  ) took  minute and  seconds and performed  operations (  ):

\. On the statistics page, view the updated total number of credits spent on .. and the new credits used for running the test scenario.

- The total number of credits is nineteen (  ).

- Four credits were spent on the test scenario (  ).

During the second run, three additional credits were consumed because the scenario ran for about a minute and a half.

 Statistics of Credit Consumption by Scenarios

View credit consumption statistics for your scenarios by setting filters at the top of the page.

The graph (  ) and the table (  ) display the scenarios executed during the specified period and the corresponding credit usage for each. The table can be sorted by scenario name or credit consumption.

Click on a scenario name in the table to view detailed information about that scenario.
