 Scenario Execution History

How to view and analyze past executions of scenarios.




If the history table is empty, you need to run the scenario. For more details on running a scenario once, see the Run once Scenario Execution section.

Every scenario run (successful or unsuccessful) is recorded in the history. The history table is accessible by clicking the History button. The table displays key information about the scenario:
